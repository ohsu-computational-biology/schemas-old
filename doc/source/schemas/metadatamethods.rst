 .. function:: searchDatasets(request)

  :param request: SearchDatasetsRequest: This request maps to the body of `POST /datasets/search` as JSON.
  :return type: SearchDatasetsResponse
  :throws: GAException

Gets a list of datasets accessible through the API.

TODO: Reads and variants both want to have datasets. Are they the same object?

`POST /datasets/search` must accept a JSON version of
`SearchDatasetsRequest` as the post body and will return a JSON version
of `SearchDatasetsResponse`.

 .. function:: getDataset(id)

  :param id: string: The ID of the `Dataset`.
  :return type: org.ga4gh.models.Dataset
  :throws: GAException

Gets a `Dataset` by ID.
`GET /datasets/{id}` will return a JSON version of `Dataset`.

.. avro:enum:: Strand

  :symbols: NEG_STRAND|POS_STRAND
  Indicates the DNA strand associate for some data item.
  * `NEG_STRAND`: The negative (-) strand.
  * `POS_STRAND`:  The postive (+) strand.

.. avro:record:: Position

  :field referenceName:
    The name of the `Reference` on which the `Position` is located.
  :type referenceName: string
  :field position:
    The 0-based offset from the start of the forward strand for that `Reference`.
      Genomic positions are non-negative integers less than `Reference` length.
  :type position: long
  :field strand:
    Strand the position is associated with.
  :type strand: Strand

  A `Position` is an unoriented base in some `Reference`. A `Position` is
  represented by a `Reference` name, and a base number on that `Reference`
  (0-based).

.. avro:enum:: CigarOperation

  :symbols: ALIGNMENT_MATCH|INSERT|DELETE|SKIP|CLIP_SOFT|CLIP_HARD|PAD|SEQUENCE_MATCH|SEQUENCE_MISMATCH
  An enum for the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
  Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used. The different enumerated values
  have the following usage:
  
  * `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be
    aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
    `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`
    operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an
    exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.
  * `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `I`.
  * `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `D`.
  * `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of
    the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is
    commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long
    segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's 'N'.
  * `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end
    of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the
    majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of
    a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped
    will still be stored in the read.
  * `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of
    a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
    alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed
    (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This
    operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.
  * `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.
    This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.
  * `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned
    sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the
    reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.
  * `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the
    aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence
    mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can
    indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.

.. avro:record:: CigarUnit

  :field operation:
    The operation type.

      If the relevant information is not available, leave this field as `null`.
  :type referenceSequence: null|string

  A structure for an instance of a CIGAR operation.
  `FIXME: This belongs under Reads (only readAlignment refers to this)`

.. avro:record:: OntologyTerm

  :field id:
    Ontology source identifier - the identifier, a CURIE (preferred) or
      PURL for an ontology source e.g. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo
      It differs from the standard GA4GH schema's :ref:`id <apidesign_object_ids>`
      in that it is a URI pointing to an information resource outside of the scope
      of the schema or its resource implementation.
  :type id: string
  :field term:

      OntologyTerm is obtained; e.g. 2.6.1.
      There is no standard for ontology versioning and some frequently
      released ontologies may use a datestamp, or build number.
  :type sourceVersion: null|string

  An ontology term describing an attribute. (e.g. the phenotype attribute
    'polydactyly' from HPO)
