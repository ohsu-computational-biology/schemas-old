SequenceAnnotations
*******************

This protocol defines annotations on GA4GH genomic sequences It includes two
types of annotations: continuous and discrete hierarchical.

The discrete hierarchical annotations are derived from the Sequence Ontology
(SO) and GFF3 work

   http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml

The goal is to be able to store annotations using the GFF3 and SO conceptual
model, although there is not necessarly a one-to-one mapping in Avro records
to GFF3 records.

The minimum requirement is to be able to accurately represent the current
state of the art annotation data and the full SO model.  Feature is the
core generic record which corresponds to the a GFF3 record.

.. avro:enum:: Strand

  :symbols: NEG_STRAND|POS_STRAND
  Indicates the DNA strand associate for some data item.
  * `NEG_STRAND`: The negative (-) strand.
  * `POS_STRAND`:  The postive (+) strand.

.. avro:record:: Position

  :field referenceName:
    The name of the `Reference` on which the `Position` is located.
  :type referenceName: string
  :field position:
    The 0-based offset from the start of the forward strand for that `Reference`.
      Genomic positions are non-negative integers less than `Reference` length.
  :type position: long
  :field strand:
    Strand the position is associated with.
  :type strand: Strand

  A `Position` is an unoriented base in some `Reference`. A `Position` is
  represented by a `Reference` name, and a base number on that `Reference`
  (0-based).

.. avro:record:: ExternalIdentifier

  :field database:
    The source of the identifier.
      (e.g. `Ensembl`)
  :type database: string
  :field identifier:
    The ID defined by the external database.
      (e.g. `ENST00000000000`)
  :type identifier: string
  :field version:
    The version of the object or the database
      (e.g. `78`)
  :type version: string

  Identifier from a public database

.. avro:enum:: CigarOperation

  :symbols: ALIGNMENT_MATCH|INSERT|DELETE|SKIP|CLIP_SOFT|CLIP_HARD|PAD|SEQUENCE_MATCH|SEQUENCE_MISMATCH
  An enum for the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
  Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used. The different enumerated values
  have the following usage:

  * `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be
    aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
    `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`
    operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an
    exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.
  * `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `I`.
  * `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `D`.
  * `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of
    the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is
    commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long
    segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's 'N'.
  * `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end
    of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the
    majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of
    a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped
    will still be stored in the read.
  * `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of
    a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
    alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed
    (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This
    operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.
  * `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.
    This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.
  * `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned
    sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the
    reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.
  * `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the
    aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence
    mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can
    indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.
