.. avro:enum:: Strand

  :symbols: NEG_STRAND|POS_STRAND
  Indicates the DNA strand associate for some data item.
  * `NEG_STRAND`: The negative (-) strand.
  * `POS_STRAND`:  The postive (+) strand.

.. avro:record:: Position

  :field referenceName:
    The name of the `Reference` on which the `Position` is located.
  :type referenceName: string
  :field position:
    The 0-based offset from the start of the forward strand for that `Reference`.
      Genomic positions are non-negative integers less than `Reference` length.
  :type position: long
  :field strand:
    Strand the position is associated with.
  :type strand: Strand

  A `Position` is an unoriented base in some `Reference`. A `Position` is
  represented by a `Reference` name, and a base number on that `Reference`
  (0-based).

.. avro:record:: ExternalIdentifier

  :field database:
    The source of the identifier.
      (e.g. `Ensembl`)
  :type database: string
  :field identifier:
    The ID defined by the external database.
      (e.g. `ENST00000000000`)
  :type identifier: string
  :field version:
    The version of the object or the database
      (e.g. `78`)
  :type version: string

  Identifier from a public database

.. avro:enum:: CigarOperation

  :symbols: ALIGNMENT_MATCH|INSERT|DELETE|SKIP|CLIP_SOFT|CLIP_HARD|PAD|SEQUENCE_MATCH|SEQUENCE_MISMATCH
  An enum for the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
  Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used. The different enumerated values
  have the following usage:

  * `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be
    aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
    `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`
    operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an
    exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.
  * `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `I`.
  * `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of
    bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's `D`.
  * `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of
    the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is
    commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long
    segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to
    SAM's 'N'.
  * `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end
    of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the
    majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of
    a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped
    will still be stored in the read.
  * `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of
    a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
    alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed
    (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This
    operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.
  * `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.
    This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.
  * `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned
    sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the
    reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.
  * `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the
    aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence
    mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can
    indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.

  :type description: null|string
  :field info:
    Additional annotation data in key-value pairs.
  :type info: null|map<array<string>>

  Evidence for the phenotype association.
  This is also a stub for further expansion.  We should consider moving this into
  it's own schema.

.. avro:record:: FeaturePhenotypeAssociation

  :field id:
  :type id: string
  :field phenotypeAssociationSetId:
    The ID of the PhenotypeAssociationSet this FeaturePhenotypeAssociation
      belongs to.
  :type phenotypeAssociationSetId: string
  :field features:
    The set of features of the organism that bears the phenotype.
        This could be as complete as a full complement of variants,
        or as minimal as the confirmed variants that are known causation
        for the annotated phenotype.
        Examples of features could be variations at the nucleotide level,
        large rearrangements at the chromosome level, or relevant epigenetic
        markers.  Relevant genomic feature types are suggested to be
        those typed in the Sequence Ontology (SO).

  :type features: array<Feature>
  :field evidence:
    The evidence for this specific instance of association between the
        features and the phenotype.
  :type evidence: array<Evidence>
  :field phenotype:
    The phenotypic component of this association.
        Note that we delegate this to a separate record to allow us the flexibility
    	to composition of phenotype associations with records that are not
    	variant sets - for example, diseases.
  :type phenotype: PhenotypeInstance
  :field description:
    A textual description of the association.
  :type description: null|string
  :field environmentalContexts:
    The context in which the phenotype arises.
      Multiple contexts can be specified - these are assumed to all hold together
  :type environmentalContexts: array<EnvironmentalContext>

  An association between one or more genomic features and a phenotype.
  The instance of association allows us to link a feature to a phenotype,
  multiple times, each bearing potentially different levels of confidence,
  such as resulting from alternative experiments and analysis.

  :field pageSize:
    Specifies the maximum number of results to return in a single page.
      If unspecified, a system default will be used.
  :type pageSize: null|int
  :field pageToken:
    The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets.
      To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of
      `nextPageToken` from the previous response.
  :type pageToken: null|string

  This request maps to the body of `POST /genotypephenotype/search` as JSON.

  The goal here is to allow users to query using one or more of
  Genotype, Phenotype, Environment, and Evidence.

  A query using one of the above items is to mean, by default,
  that the remainder of the query is as a "wildcard", such
  that all matches to just that query term would come back.
  Combinations of the above are to act like AND rather than OR.

  The "genotype" part of the query methods can be one or more
  genomic features.  Associations can be made at many
  levels of granularity (from whole genotypes down to individual
  SNVs), but users may use these methods with partial or
  inexact information.  Therefore, the query methods must be
  able to support query of some or all of the associated features.
  Furthermore, use of the relationships between genomic features
  means that when querying for a gene, any variants to that
  gene are also returned.  For example, a query with
  BRCA2 would mean that in addition to any direct associations
  to the BRCA2, all associations to sequence variants of BRCA2 would also
  be returned.  Similarly, queries with OntologyTerms should perform
  the subclass closure.

  Each query can be made against a string, an array of external
  identifers (such as for gene or SNP ids), ontology term ids, or
  full feature/phenotype/evidence objects.

.. avro:record:: SearchGenotypePhenotypeResponse

  :field associations:
    The list of matching FeaturePhenotypeAssociation.
  :type associations: array<org.ga4gh.models.FeaturePhenotypeAssociation>
  :field nextPageToken:
    The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets.
      Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of
      results. This field will be empty if there aren't any additional results.
  :type nextPageToken: null|string

  This is the response from `POST /genotypephenotype/search` expressed as JSON.

  :field id:
    The ID of the `Entity`.
  :type id: string
